# **ONNX**

In client side application, based on [onnxruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/) to execute standard graph.

> ONNX Runtime is a cross-platform machine-learning model accelerator, with a flexible interface to integrate hardware-specific libraries. ONNX Runtime can be used with models from PyTorch, Tensorflow/Keras, TFLite, scikit-learn, and other frameworks.

Any analyzer for ONNX part, I added pre-processing layer to my `*.onnx` model to reduce image manipulations.
